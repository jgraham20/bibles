<c n="3">
<v n="16">"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.</v>
<v n="17">For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him.</v>
<v n="18">Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.</v>
<v n="19">And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their deeds were evil.</v>
<v n="20">For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed.</v>
